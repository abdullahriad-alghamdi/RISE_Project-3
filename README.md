# Weather-Journal App Project
The Weather-Journal App is a web application designed to allow users to enter their zip code and a brief description of how they're feeling to receive the current weather data for their location and save it to a server. This project was created as a part of Udacity's Front End Web Development course.

## Overview
The Weather-Journal App is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript on the client-side, and Node.js and Express.js on the server-side. It uses the OpenWeatherMap API to retrieve weather data.

## Features
* Responsive design for different screen sizes.
* Allows users to enter a zip code and a brief description of how they're feeling.
* Displays the current temperature, date, and user's feeling.
* Saves user data to a server.
* Retrieves the saved data from the server and displays it on the app.
